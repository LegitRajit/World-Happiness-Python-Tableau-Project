# World Happiness Report Python/Tableau Project Overview

Inside of this repository is my exploratory analysis on the World Happiness Report from 2015-2022. The primary objective for this project was to deepen my understanding of Python, such as performing regression analysis, cluster analysis, and more to help.
This project was apart of Career Foundry as an exploratory analysis. 

The dataset was sourced from a [user on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report)

The repository has multiple folders which I will provide a brief overview:

**01 Project Management:** Contains the Career Foundry Instacart project brief alongside my own project overview brief. 

**02 Data:** Both excel files for the original data and the cleaned data. 

**03 Scripts:** Contains python scripts of the entire Career Foundry Python module. Some things I did include: data cleaning, data merging, column derivations, and creating visualizations (correlation matrix)

**04 Analysis/Visualizations:** This folder contains all my visualizations that I created throughout the entire module. 

**05 Sent to Client:** Contains a PDF of a powerpoint presentation on this project (alongside other projects i've done for Career Foundry)
